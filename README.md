# VBS


## This is a compilation of VBScript code for different tasks (Also SAP GUI scripting)

### What they do:

#### 1. [SAP_login: ](https://github.com/Lep3188/VBS/blob/master/SAP_login.vbs)
This code is for SAP login, only remove the GUI recording and add yours with your login credentials. Also, remember that the first 
variable stores the SAP Logonpad "Name " of the System Description you want to execute. (On my work script I use cases to select the enviroment I want to open)


#### 2. [PowerballGenerator: ](https://github.com/Lep3188/VBS/blob/master/PowerballGenerator.VBS)
Code to generate random lottery ticket numbers.(Note: This is for entertainment purposes only, not responsible of your gambling choises.)


#### 3. [Input to voice: ](https://github.com/Lep3188/VBS/blob/master/Voice_By_Text_Input.vbs)
Takes user input and transforms it into audio.


#### 4. [Input to voice: ](https://github.com/Lep3188/VBS/blob/master/ScreenOn.vbs)
Maintains the computer awake, sometimes companyâ€™s machines go to sleep if unattended and nothing can prevent it from happening. This script will help to maintain it awake and nobody will find out.
