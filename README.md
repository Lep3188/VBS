# VBS


## This is a compilation of VBScript code for different tasks (Also SAP GUI scripting)

### What they do:

1. SAP_login: This code is for SAP login, only remove the GUI recording and add yours with your login credentials. Also, remember that the first 
variable stores the SAP Logonpad "Name " of the System Description you want to execute. (On my work script I use cases to select the enviroment I want to open)
